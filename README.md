<p align="center">Find out what your IP address says about you</p>

## Description

IP Quality Score is a free and fully open source solution to find out
as much information as possible about your IP address.

This web app gives you information about your location, ISP, VPN statistics,
fraud score, and more.

## Setup

There are no special setup instructions for this project. For smaller
uses of this, no API keys are required, however if your project is
expecting larger amounts of requests, you will most likely be rate limited
by one of the APIs used.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using PHP and Laravel, with a React.JS frontend.

## To-Do

Ideally, I'd like to rewrite portions of the frontend to be more modern.
I'm not sure when I'll do this, but it could look nicer.

I'd like to improve WebRTC IP detection soon, since there's better
ways of doing it than what is currently being used in this project.

Additionally, I'm considering including information about DNS leaks,
information from phishstats, and more, to improve the quality of the results
given by IP Quality Score.
